# DEPI-Project
# 📊 Bitcoin Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

This project focuses on analyzing historical data of Bitcoin from 2018 to 2025.
The goal is to build a clean, feature-rich dataset that captures market behavior and can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and dashboard visualization.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I developed a complete data preprocessing pipeline that:

* Combines multiple timeframes (15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
* Cleans and validates the dataset
* Engineers advanced financial features
* Prepares a structured dataset for analysis and modeling

## 📂 Dataset

* Source: Kaggle Bitcoin Historical Dataset
* Time Period: 2018 – 2025
* Timeframes:

  * 15 Minutes
  * 1 Hour
  * 4 Hours
  * 1 Day

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps:

* Merged multiple datasets into one unified DataFrame
* Converted time columns to datetime format (UTC)
* Sorted data chronologically
* Removed missing values and invalid records
* Eliminated duplicates based on (Open time, timeframe)
* Extracted time-based features:

  * Year
  * Month
  * Day
  * Quarter

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

### 📈 Price Features

* `price_change` → Close - Open
* `return_pct` → Price return percentage
* `volatility` → High - Low

---

### 📊 Trend Features

* `trend_direction` → Uptrend / Downtrend
* `trend_length` → Consecutive trend duration
* `trend_strength` → Price movement weighted by volume

---

### 💰 Volume & Market Activity

* Buy/Sell volume
* Buy/Sell ratios
* Order flow
* Capital flow
* Trade activity

---

### 🚨 Market Behavior Signals

* High volatility
* Compression (low activity periods)
* Volume spikes
* Overheating (strong bullish pressure)
* Whale activity

---

### 📉 Technical Indicators

* Support & Resistance levels
* Breakout detection (up/down) using rolling windows

---

## 🧠 Output

Final dataset:

```bash
bitcoin_kpis.csv
```

This dataset is ready for:

* Data analysis
* Machine learning models
* Time-series forecasting
* Trading strategy development

---

## 📊 Dashboard (Coming Soon)

An interactive dashboard will be added to visualize:

* Price trends
* Volume behavior
* Market signals
* Breakout events

Tools that may be used:

* Power BI / Tableau
* Python (Plotly / Dash / Streamlit)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* KaggleHub

---

## 📌 Future Work

* Build predictive models (price movement / trend prediction)
* Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)
* Develop an interactive dashboard
* Deploy the project
